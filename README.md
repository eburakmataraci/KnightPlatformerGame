**Knight Platformer** is a 2D Java Swing action game. Control a knight through six unique levels: Desert, Snow, Rain, Wasteland, War, and Space. Jump, roll, and strike with light or heavy attacks, defeat enemies, and reach the goal. Checkpoints and lives balance the challenge, while particle effects and fullscreen scaling enhance the arcade-style gameplay.
